Choosing a *laptop for engineering student* can be quite a difficult process. the choice of different models and options is simply overwhelming. In general, you can write code on any laptop, but it is still better to take into account a number of points that increase comfort and productivity. What to look for when choosing a laptop for development, I will try to figure it out in this post. The main condition that I will take into account is that the laptop will be used for web development as the main working machine.

With that said, I would like to offer you five lines of laptops from different manufacturers, which, in my opinion, are great for web development. With them, you definitely will not have questions about why the flash drive is not seen. The article outlines all the problems why the flash drive is not detected and how to fix the problem if you have it on your laptop.

I deliberately did not list any specific models in the list, but presented only the lines of laptops that I personally would pay attention to, having one or another budget. I personally am a supporter of Acer, tk. I consider their laptops the most interesting in terms of price / quality ratio, but for fairness I did not give different lines of one company. For example, I would choose something from the Acer Swift 3 line.

**Mobility**

Laptops today come in a variety of sizes and formats. It is necessary to determine how portable the laptop should be. If you do not carry it with you often, but only within your home or office, then you should take larger models, with 15″ or even 17″ screens. As a rule, such models have the best characteristics and performance.

In the case when you often move between different locations, work in a cafe, on the street, or just often travel with a laptop, then you should pay attention to more compact models. Options with 13″ and 14″ screens will be more preferable. These laptops are smaller and lighter. Also often more autonomous, i.e. able to work more on a single battery charge.

Often among compact laptops you can find 2-in-1 models (the so-called transformers). These are models that combine the functions of a tablet and a laptop, have a touch screen. In most cases, having a touch screen does not offer any advantage for engineering student, so it's only worth paying extra for such a feature if you really need it.

**Display**

The laptop display is one of the key features for engineering students. Application development is a long process and a lot of time is spent in front of the screen. The screen should not create discomfort and create minimal strain on the eyesight. The choice of screen must be approached responsibly.

Inexpensive laptop models still come with low resolution displays (less than 1920 by 1080). Such screens should not be taken for web development. First of all, because at low resolution the text on the screen is not very clear and is not comfortable to read. Plus, it is inconvenient to use multitasking functions when you need to place several applications on the screen at the same time. The low resolution makes this extremely inconvenient. Choose laptops with a resolution of at least fullHD (1920 by 1080).

Today, a number of laptop for engineering students are offered with a 4K screen resolution, but for a laptop this does not provide any tangible advantages. Don't overpay for a screen like this. In addition, a higher resolution screen tends to consume more power, which means having a 4K display will have a negative impact on battery life.

Therefore, a fullHD (1920 x 1080) resolution screen is the best choice. In addition, I would recommend taking models with an IPS matrix and a matte finish. Such displays have better viewing angles and do not create glare, which has a positive effect on the comfort of long-term work.
